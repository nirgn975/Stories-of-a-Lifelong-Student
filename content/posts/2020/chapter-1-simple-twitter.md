Something about this chapter.


## 1. Git Setup

First thing first we need some general softwares for development. The most important one is [git](https://git-scm.com/). We gonna use git for version control from day one, and we'll host our code on [GitHub](https://github.com/) - because it's free for open repositories and it's where everyone is at right now.
While I'm using Mac and I'll show how to install everything on a Mac, it should be pretty easy to install everything in this book on Linux and Windows too. Everyone of the tools we'll use is well known and should be plenty of resources and help on the internet.

### 1.1. Install git

I recommend to use a package manager to install everything on your machine, on mac it's brew. Once you have [brew](https://brew.sh/) installed on your machine all you need to do to install `git` is:

```bash
$ brew install git
```

That's it, now if you'll write `git` on your command line of choice you'll get as an output all the git commands you can use.

### 1.2. Open a GitHub account

GitHub is a web based git with some extra features. We don't need to install anything to use GitHub, just open an account and configure some stuff. So let's do it! Let's go to https://github.com and pick a `username`, `email`, `password` and click on the big green button says *Sign up for GitHub*.

After you sign up you'll need to confirm your account, so check your email. Now we need to config `git` with our `email` and `username`. We can do it by typing those command:

```bash
$ git config --global user.name "Nir Galon"
$ git config --global user.email nirgn975@gmail.com
```

That's it for now. Once we'll have some code, we'll open a new repository, commit the code to GitHub and talk about issues and pull requests.

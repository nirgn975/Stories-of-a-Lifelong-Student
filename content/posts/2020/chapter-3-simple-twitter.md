In this chapter we're going to open a new repository on GitHub and commit everything to it. We will learn about issues, pull requests (PR), branches, etc. And talk about the way we're going to work with GitHub for the rest of the book.
We'll also start a new [Angular](https://angular.io/) application with [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/), create the backend project with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and the [express](https://expressjs.com/) framework, and install all the packages we'll need for the client and backend.

&nbsp;

## 1. GitHub Workflow

issues and pull requests, run tests, run codecov (dont merge if tests not work), squash and merge.

&nbsp;

## 2. Scaffolding Basic Client

ngrx, material, core module, basic scss style, github action to run lint and tests, add codecov, add badges

&nbsp;

## 3. Scaffolding Basic Server

something

typescript, nodemon, .env, dummy data import, github action to run lint and tests, add codecov, add badges

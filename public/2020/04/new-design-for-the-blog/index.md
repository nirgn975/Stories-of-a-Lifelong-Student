# New design for the blog!

I'm really excited for this! Don't ask me why because I can't explain it. This is not the first time I make a new design for this blog, it's actually the fifth time! and yet, I feel this is the best one yet. It have everything I ever wanted in my blog.

## 1. New Design

I can't even start to describe to you how much I feel this design is perfect for this blog. It have all the features I wanted: automatic categories and tags, content section in the posts, comments system that isn't sell your privacy and take forever to load (yes disqus I'm looking at you!), and dark mode! Ohh dark mode (It's not for everyone, I know, that's why it's optional).

Let's break it down

### 1.1 Navigation

The navigation at the upper right side of the website contains all the configuration and links of the website.

![Navigation](/images/posts/2020/new-design-for-the-blog/navigation.jpg "Navigation")

#### 1.1.1 Posts

The [Posts](/posts) page will have all of the posts of the blog, it'll be ordered by year and will show the title of the post and the date it was published.

#### 1.1.2 Tags

Every post will have a list of tags, basically the main topics the post is about. The [Tags](/tags) page will host all of those tags. This way you can glance on all of the topics I write about and click on one of them and get a list of the posts that have that tag. This is really a great and easy way to search for a post topic.

#### 1.1.3 Categories

In Contrast to the Tags page the [Categories](/categories) page contains a list of all the posts divided by categories that I set in advance, each post can be in only one category so this is me trying to categorize all the posts by topics that I think are related and I want to explore (or maybe even write s series of posts about a single thing).

#### 1.1.4 About

The [About](/about) page is a simple one, it's just one static page with some information about me and the history of the blog. If you want to contact me, there is couple of ways to do that and it's all in there.

#### 1.1.5 GitHub Link

[GitHub](https://github.com/nirgn975) is the main platform I'm on right now (and [twitter](https://twitter.com/nirgn975)), it's the most important one because it's store all of my projects (work and private ones), my code examples, etc. And it makes sense to expect that I will direct readers there during the posts, so it's handy to have a direct link.

#### 1.1.6 Dark Mode!

People that know me, know how much I love dark mode! I can't explain it, it's just easier on my eyes.

I loved the old design on the blog, but not having a dark mode was a major bug. So the new design 

### 1.2 Post
Something about the new Post design.

### 1.3 Comments
Something about the Comments system.

## 2. New language

I'm also decided to make the move and start writing in English (I think it have a big part of my excitement). English is not my native language (Hebrew is) so don't expect perfect. But I think I'm good enough to make it readable and I'm sure it'll get better over time.

## 3. Summary

The project has been updated, maintained, bugs are squashed and everything is looking good and work great! I'm really happy with it's current situation.

Just one more thing. If you ever used or try this project, I'll be thrilled to get a link or hear from you how you use it, and what it helps you accomplished. I want to hear about your issues and how this project can help you solve them.
